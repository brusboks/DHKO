**14:10 – 14:40** DHKO Unconference – Chair: Camilla Holm Soelseth (Lecturer, OsloMet)

This part of the conference concerns both people who are - or wish to be part of - the network and people with a more casual interest in the topic. We will break into smaller groups, and every group gets to talk together and write down some initial wishes for what they want the research network to do (activities, events, etc) in the coming years. In addition, the groups will also provide suggestions for how to make these things happen. These will be suggestions which DHKO can follow up on in the coming year. This will result in a formal constitution of the network and, hopefully, the constitution of a larger working group for 2024.

**14:40 – 14:50** Short Stretch

**14:50 – 15:45** Keynote - Chair: Annika Rockenberger (Senior Academic Librarian, UiO)

- Sally Chambers (DH Research Coordinator, Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities): From Data Spaces to Collections as Data: bridging the gap between large-scale initiatives and day-to-day practices

*Abstract:* Cultural heritage data is increasingly being considered as humanities research data ([Tasovac et al., 2020](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02961317) and [DARIAH Annual Event 2023](https://www.dariah.eu/2023/07/07/recap-of-the-annual-event-2023-cultural-heritage-data-as-humanities-research-data/)). With the emergence of initiatives such as the [common European data space for cultural heritage](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage) and the [Cultural Heritage Cloud](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/social-sciences-and-humanities/cultural-heritage-and-cultural-and-creative-industries-ccis/cultural-heritage-cloud_en) it is even more essential that cultural heritage institutions engage in such data spaces. However, the gap between such large scale initiatives and day-to-day practice can often seem huge. This presentation will introduce the [common European data space for cultural heritage](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage) and the [Cultural Heritage Cloud](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/social-sciences-and-humanities/cultural-heritage-and-cultural-and-creative-industries-ccis/cultural-heritage-cloud_en) and attempt to interconnect them with similar initiatives of relevance to the Digital Humanities, such as [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu) and [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu) and [the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en). Finally, the interconnection will be made with grassroots activities such as [Collections as Data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io) and [GLAM Labs](https://glamlabs.io) by introducing a [checklist to publish collections as data in GLAM institutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02603) and how it is being transformed into [a workflow within the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/workflow/I3JvP6). This presentation will be illustrated by a number of case studies where Collections as Data and GLAM Labs have been implemented in local cultural heritage institutions, such as the [DATA-KBR-BE project](https://www.kbr.be/en/projects/data-kbr-be/) at KBR, Royal Library of Belgium within the context of digital humanities networks such as [DH Benelux](https://dhbenelux.org). 

**15:45 – 16:00** Closing summary – Chair: Annika Rockenberger (Senior Academic Librarian, UiO) & Camilla Holm Soelseth (Lecturer, OsloMet)
